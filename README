Gitorial Tools
==============

These are a couple of tools I used to develop gitorials.

Example:

The source:  http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial-patches/tree/master
The gitorial repository: http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial-patches/tree/master
The output: http://cookbook.hobocentral.net/gitorials/agility

gitorial.rb
-----------

If all of your git commit messages are in Markdown format, this will
assemble your git history into a single Markdown file.  Initialize
with `git log -p --reverse` and the base URL for commit links.

Any line in a commit message that consists solely of `SHOW_PATCH` will
be replaced with the patch trimmed down to improve readability.

A commit link is placed at the end of each commit.  This is wrapped in
a `p.commit` tag.

We use [Dan Webb's Unobtrusive Code
Highlighter](http://svn.danwebb.net/external/CodeHighlighter/trunk/)
to style the patches.  You're welcome to steal our
[diff.js](http://github.com/tablatom/hobocookbook/blob/master/public/javascripts/highlighters/diff.js).
It's easy enough to use your own highlighter -- patches are wrapped in
`code.diff`.

gitorial-bulk-tag
-----------------

This script tags every commit in the repository.

gitorial-stg-import
-------------------

Given a quilt/stgit series file, this uses stgit to create a gitorial
repository.  See [the agility gitorial
source](http://github.com/bryanlarsen/agility-gitorial-patches/tree/master)
for an example.
